Conditions of use
-------------

CHEEREIO is completely free and provided under a highly permissive MIT license. That said, we have a few requests if you use CHEEREIO:

#. **Don't be a stranger**: Send me an email about how you are using CHEEREIO (andrew.pendergrass [at] duke [dot] edu). This helps me decide future development priorities, and will help me better support you through the inevitable challenges that will emerge in data assimilation applications.
#. **Cite appropriately**: If you are submitting a paper for publication, see the below :ref:`appropriate citations` section for a list of references that have introduced CHEEREIO features. Please cite all papers that introduce features you use (in addition to the original 2023 CHEEREIO paper) as a way of recognizing efforts from the community.
#. **Ask for help, preferably through a GitHub issue**: I am happy to help and I usually reply within one working day. All problems and questions, no matter how minor, should reported by opening an `issue <https://github.com/drewpendergrass/CHEEREIO/issues>`__ on Github, as this will allow all users to see the solution. You can also email me. 
#. **If you have gotten significant help using CHEEREIO, consider offering coauthorship**. Co-authorship is not a condition of CHEEREIO use. We only ask that you cite papers appropriately. However, if you've gotten significant support on debugging CHEEREIO, interpreting output, or introducing new features, consider offering co-authorship to those who helped you. 
#. **Offer your contributions to the community** by making a GitHub pull request. If you've added a new observation operator or otherwise made code adjustments, be in touch via email and make a pull request on GitHub. This will allow me to add your code to a future CHEEREIO release; I'll also update the citation section so that your efforts are recognized by future users of your code. If you need help making a pull request, just send an email to andrew.pendergrass [at] duke [dot] edu.
